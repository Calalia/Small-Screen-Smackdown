# Small-Screen-Smackdown

This repository holds the scripts of project Small Screen Smackdown.
The project was made using Unity C# and Photon Unity Networking for the multiplayer. We worked on it from 2.7.2019 to 26.7.2019.
The game is a multiplayer 1v1 moba for mobile platforms, built for Android.
We intend to implement sounds to the game after release since we already had them made.

I was lead programmer in this project and responsible for the multiplayer functionality.
The team consisted of 3 programmers, 4 artists and a designer.

I had something to do with every script in the project.
Making this, I learned a lot about multiplayer programming. This was my first dive into it. I also tested some UI designs for mobile platforms and had both successful and unsuccessful ones.
During my work in the four team projects (that this is the latest of) I also learned the production process of developing games and teamwork skills specific to games industry. The roles were almost the same for each project and we noticed immediately if a role was left unfilled because that caused problems. 

I'm happy with what we could achieve in the short span of the project and therefore I feel that this shows my skills in C# in Unity environment.
